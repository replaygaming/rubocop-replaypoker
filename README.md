Common Ruby style settings. This gem takes all the settings and version controls
still giving to the developer the ability to make per project adjustments.

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

This gem assume that it will be used in the project with the linter settings
inheritance would be something like this:

0. Rubocop gem defaults, [link](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/blob/master/config/default.yml)
1. The settings from this gem, [link](https://github.com/replaygaming/rubocop-replaypoker/blob/master/config/default.yml)
2. The auto-gen-config (see in your project `.rubocop_todo.yml`)
    * This file is auto generated by rubocop with the command `bundler exec rubocop --auto-gen-config` and stub all the warnings from rubocop.
    * Keep this file empty in the `master` branch
3. Project specific settings (see in your project `.rubocop_local_overrides.yml`)
    * rubocop gem have the variety of extra addons which might be added and require some extra settings or the project might require some adjustments against the already defined settings. All of it should be in here.

To apply this structure copy [link](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/blob/master/templates/.rubocop.yml)
to your project root.

### Notes && gotchas

* Rubocop gem have an awesome auto-correction feature. There are 2 modes: safe & ricky. To run safe option use `bundle exec rubocop -a` and for ricky use `bundle exec rubocop -A`.
* Some rubocop cops depend on the settings from another cops (`Layout/LineLength` cop is a great example), so if you added some code which break this cop and there is no way to auto-correct it and then executed `bundler exec rubocop auto-gen-config` it produce the new cop `Max` setting and it would be applied  all the dependencies. It might produce a lot of unwanted changes.
* Because of the previous trait i recommend to `git commit` all your changes and run rubocop afterwards, and then apply the changes with something like `git add . && git commit --amend --no-edit`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
